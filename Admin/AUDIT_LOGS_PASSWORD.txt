   AUDIT LOGS ACCESS PASSWORD
===========================================

Default Password: admin@audit2024

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This password protects access to the Audit Logs section.

🔒 SECURITY BEHAVIOR:
- Audit Logs page is ALWAYS locked when you first visit
- You must enter the password EVERY TIME you visit the page
- When you navigate away from Audit Logs, it locks again automatically
- The lock does NOT persist between page visits (for security)

To change this password:
1. Open: Admin/src/pages/AuditLogs.jsx
2. Find: const AUDIT_LOGS_PASSWORD = 'admin@audit2024';
3. Change to your desired password
4. Save the file

For production, consider:
- Moving password to environment variable
- Using a more secure password
- Implementing password rotation
